# OSM Editor Imagery Index

The goal of this project is to maintain a representation of imagery 
overlays and layers useful for editing historic features in editors 
that communicate with an OpenStreetMap-based API such as
[iD](https://github.com/systemed/iD), [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/), 
and [Potlatch 2](https://github.com/systemed/potlatch2).

This list is for imagery not present in the [editor-imagery-index](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-imagery-index) and is for imagery only useful for historic mapping, not general-purpose mapping.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for help on how to contribute.

## Using this index

### iD
How?

### JOSM

For JOSM you can add `http://osmlab.github.io/historic-imagery-index/imagery.xml` 
to the preference key `imagery.layers.sites` in advanced preferences. You probably
want to remove the `https://josm.openstreetmap.de/maps` entry or you'll get the 
same imagery listed twice.
